# House_Price
Predict the price of the house using multiple features
You will require all the files. Ex1data2 is a example dataset. The feature normalization is done only for one feature, for the first column. Some tweaking of the code will be required to do it for multiple features. You need to directly run the predict_house_price function and pass the value of step size(alpha) and number of iterations for gradient descent.
