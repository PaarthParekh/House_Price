# House_Price
Predict the price of the house using multiple features
You will require all the files. Ex1data2 is a example dataset. 
The feature normalization is done only for one feature, for the first column. You need to directly run the predict_house_price function and pass the value of step size(alpha) and number of iterations for gradient descent.
