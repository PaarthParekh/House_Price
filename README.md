# House_Price
#### Predict the price of the house using multiple features
##### To train the model using Gradient Descent 
You will require all the files from Gradient_descent.  
The feature normalization is done only for one feature, for the first column. 
You need to directly run the predict_house_price function and pass the value of step size(alpha) and number of iterations for gradient descent to get the value of theta.
##### To train the model using Normal Equation 
You will require all the files from Normal_Equation. You have to run the command predict_house_normal() to get the value of theta.
##### To Predict the price of the House
Upload your training data when the prompt shows up. Enter the size and the number of bedrooms of the house seperated by commas or space when asked for the input.
