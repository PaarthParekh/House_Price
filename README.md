# House_Price
###### Predict the price of the house using multiple features
You will require computeCostMulti.m,feature_normal.m,gradientDescentMulti.m,load_data.m and predict_house_price.m. Ex1data2 is a example dataset. 
The feature normalization is done only for one feature, for the first column. You need to directly run the predict_house_price function and pass the value of step size(alpha) and number of iterations for gradient descent.Put your training data ,and size and number of bedrooms of the house to predict the price to get the price via gradient descent.
To train the model using normal equation, download the file load_data.m,normalEqn.m and predict_house_normal.m. You have to run the command predict_house_normal(), put your training data ,and size and number of bedrooms of the house to predict the price.
